## ESP Part

The ESP part of the project involves the firmware and configuration for the ESP32 microcontroller, which is responsible for collecting sensor data and controlling various hardware components in the smart farm.

### Firmware

The firmware for the ESP32 is written in C++ and uses the Arduino framework. It handles the following tasks:

- Collecting data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture).
- Controlling actuators (e.g., water pumps, LED lights).
- Communicating with the server via Wi-Fi.
